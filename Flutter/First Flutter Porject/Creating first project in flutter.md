# First flutter project

- `flutter create <project_name>`

### File structure

- `.idea` file: config file, don't touch in 98% of the cases.
- `android` & `ios` folders: native projects, can be opened in android studio and x-code respectively (usually don't touch until and unless you are writing a large code and require some native features as well)
- `lib` folder: goto directory, do everything in this folder
- `test` folder: some testing (widget testing, functinoality working or not).
- `.gitignore`: _come on man_
- `.metadata` & `.packages`: **Just leave them alone BRO**
- `<project_name>.iml`: usually don't touch.
- `pubspec.lock`: don't touch
- `pubspec.yaml`: _pretty awesome file_
- `readme.md`: _Documentation bruh_
